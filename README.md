# FizzBuzz
A simple program which plays FizzBuzz up to a number of your choice.

For those who don't know how FizzBuzz works, you count up from 1, but:
 - Every time a number is a multiple of 3, you say "Fizz" 
 - Every time a number is a multiple of 5, you say "Buzz" 
 - Every time the number is a multiple of both 3 and 5 you say "FizzBuzz"
